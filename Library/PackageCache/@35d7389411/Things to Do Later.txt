Easing Curves: https://easings.net/

THINGS TO DO: 
- Interruptible Fade In/Out Animation -> Will require a rewrite where there will only be one timer for every animation 
- UI Timeline for easy visualization
- TextMeshPro kerning option, where the letters expand in length
- Exclude Button Text in Position and Rotation option -> Will need the script to remember which one is a child object

FUTURE FEATURES
- For the text-altering, we need some shader and masking
- Emphasis (Effects over lifetime, with automatic fade out timer)
